## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

## Additional packages

-   [Laravel Clockwork](https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork): Used for logging and debugging
    You then would need to download the browser extension for Chrome or Firefox to use it.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

laravel new project-name
# To run the server
php artisan serve

# To open shell into server
php artisan tinker
# Make migrations
php artisan migrate
# Rollback migrations
php artisan migrate:rollback
# Refresh migrations
php artisan migrate:refresh
# To seed database using seeder

    php artisan make:model Post -msf
    ```

### Factory usage

        ```php
        // To use the factory manually in the tinker shell or in a controller
        Post::factory()->count(50)->create();
        ```

        ```bash
        # To use the seeder
        php artisan db:seed
        ```

    # To start the mysql server
    brew services start mysql
    # To login to mysql
    mysql -u root -p
    # To show databases
    show databases;
    # To create a database
    create database laravel;
    # To use a database

    # To show tables
    show tables;
    # To create a table
    create table users (id int, name varchar(255));
    ```

## Blade Templating Engine

Methods of components:

1. You can either use the @extends('layout') to extend a layout with sections for inputting content.
2. Create a new folder in the views folder called components. Everything in here will be automatically made available in your blade files. It allows for using curly braces instead of @ directives for inserting content

The second method is the preferred method.

## Procedure for using components

1. Create a new folder in the views folder called components (if it doesn't exist)
2. Create a new blade file in the components folder
3. Use the blade file in the views folder

## Procedure for building models

1. Create a new migration file and models using the command: php artisan make:model ModelName -m
2. Add the columns to the migration file
3. Run the migration using the command: php artisan migrate
4. Add the fillable/protected columns to the model
5. Add the relationships to the model by adding methods to the model that return the relationshp: hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany, etc.
6. Once the relationships have been added, to avoid n+1 queries, use the with() method to eager load any relationships
   eg. Post::with('user', 'category')->get();
7. Define the properties for the factory in the model factory file. You can generate a factory file using the command: php artisan make:factory ModelNameFactory. Then define the properties for the factory in the file.
8. Add the factory to the database seeder file
9. Add seeds to the database using the command: php artisan db:seed (This will use the seeder file in the database/seeders folder)

## Helpful tips

When creating a DB model, you should aim to buid migrations first, then models, then controllers. This is the best practice for building a Laravel application.

The commands used for building migrations and models are:

    ```bash
    # To make a migration
    php artisan make:migration create_posts_table
    # To make an Eloquent model
    php artisan make:model Post
    # Combined above commands (will auto create migration file)
    php artisan make:model Post -m
    ```
